\pause

\textbf{How is advice structured online?}

This work aims to advance both our understanding of how people give advice, as well as to provide resources for learning to identify advice

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{How good are computational models at identifying advice?}

We establish preliminary baselines with rule-based models~\citep{negi-etal-2019-semeval,potamias-etal-2019-ntua} and BERT~\citep{devlin_bert:_2019}, and analyze their performance.
